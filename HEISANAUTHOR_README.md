It's me, Al, if you got the email notification about this repository, you have two choices. Delete or to read this whole readme file. I just want to say that I'm not mad at you nor at your lover. But never that I would be happy for the both of you. I just couldn't find myself being happy for someone I had a conflicting relationship with. I'm not one of those people who tend to say or believe "If you love her, let her go.". I let you go because I do not have even an ounce of love to give. Plus, why would I be happy when all you did was make me a foolish person to begin with. I can sense that you'll be able to live differently from what you did because I have faith in people who had wronged me. Don't be discouraged when it comes to commiting to the things you like or whatever it is that you like to do with your life. Enjoy and live your life to the fullest and take care always.


Even though you haven't asked. I'm doing fine. I'm doing so much better (in so many aspects of my life, and I do focus on someone else that I like)than having to deal with a senseless relationship. Being friends with someone you once had an intimate relationship feels awful in my own opinion and experience.


I'll see you at school then, if there would be a chance. Lol. but there's nothing to expect about that.


Goodbye, Froggo, Katrina.


And also, one last thing before you stop reading this. Please listen to this. You'll have a better lifespan once you listen to this.
